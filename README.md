The MiSTer arcade landscape needs to mature.<br> 
Seems to have strong "consolidation" feel. <br>
Unnecessary focus on USB input, and HDMI output.<br> 

Few folks seem to have actual "arcade" experience, or own cabs. <br>

"MiSTer is not made specifically for arcade cabinets. It's primarily for home TV use" <br>

"As a potential customer feedback, my use of MiSTer is... arcade: being able to play in a cab (JVS, mostly, but JAMMA option is still cool although I see it more as an external add-on)... having a DB15 connector is a must have IMO)" <br>

"While i can't help with output part (it's very specific to each arcade if it doesn't provide standard input like HDMI), i plan to make a thread where i can explain how to connect buttons easily to MiSTer without changing anything in MiSTer." <br>

"I would suggest looking to the JVS standard for inspiration to avoid future head-aches."<br>

"I think the 2nd player controls are still pretty wonky on MiSTer, maybe them devs need mates to actually understand that gaming isnt only about player 1 :P"<br>

I personally don't usually use JAMMA, I'm more of a JVS guy. My cabs do however have the following looms. <br>
