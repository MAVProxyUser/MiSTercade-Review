'Just remember what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol' storm right square in the eye and he says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."'

Some of you may be a bit young, but Jack Burton is one of the main characters in Big Trouble in Little China.  

This is not going to be your normal MisterCade review... I've watched a few now, and most folks tend to focus on the fact that they are having fun, and able to do so in their 
arcade cab. Very few seem to tackle any more than a cursory scratch on the surface of the MiSTer landscape itself that supports MiStercade.

I want to first say that some of you will find this to be overly critical, and honestly may get offended. Constructive criticism can be hard to absorb, especially when you are
in the process of soaking up all the positive energy from recent articles in The Verge!

My first MiSTer exposure was in 2019. I was admiditly curious, but skeptical, due to my oversion to MAME. "Forget emulation? this is REcreation" was the title to the now gone video.

based on the date of my Tweet, I'm pretty sure it was when the Neo Geo core was relesaed. I was at that time restoring an MVS system in my arcade, so this was quite intriguing to me.

Both the original post, and video are long gone.

I've since bought two bundles from Porkchop Express aka Mister Addons or JackBurton in some circles. I have both a Standard, and Digital IO, as well as some SNAC accessories
that allow me to plug in my native controllers for PC Engine, and Super Nintendo. Generally speaking I don't care too much about the arcade cores, I'm more interested in the console 
cores for Genesis, NES, SNES, PCEngine, GameBoy, and Gameboy Advance.

Honestly before the CPS2 core came out in beta, I've not really cared much about the older arcade PCB's that are recreated as fpga cores for MiSTer.

The Cave core is pretty lit of course. This goes without saying. https://www.patreon.com/nullobject

The PSX core is also interesting to me, but is clearly a bit early to discuss. https://www.patreon.com/laxer3a

Over all I am notoriously anti emulation, as I've stated a number of times, so adopting MiSTer requires an extremely focused eye on the supporting landscape. If even the slightest
thing is out of place it will annoy me to no end, and make me subject to not using the platform at all.

"latency" isn't really a conversation piece for me, although I know it is a huge thing for other folks. Porkchop Express maintains for example that largest spreadsheet that I am 
aware of documenting lag in MiSter input options.

"accuracy" is something I care quite a bit about, both in "video output" / "stick input", as well as in over all experience. So the first annoyance for me was what seemed to be an 
obsession with USB input. This was the first place that I got the feeling that the MiSTer arcade landscape needs to mature a little. There seems to be a strong "consolidation" feel
to the whole project. For me stems feel stems from an unnecessary focus on USB input, key mapping, and HDMI output.<br> 

Despite the uptick in "arcade" marketing for various accessories for MiSTer, few folks seem to have actual "arcade" experience, or actually own cabs, let alone more than one. <br>
This generally isn't a problem for most MiSTer users, but as an arcade operator coming into the mix, it is extremely annoying. Some of the workflows in the menuing system are almost 
complete non-starters for actual use in an arcade with end users whom have never heard of MiSTer, or flat out don't care to know. Most folks that touch my machines just want to play
the game that I have set on the Marquee. The folks operating my machines in various locations simply want to be able to turn them off, and back on in the event of a problem, expecting
that they will boot back up ready to rock. At the very least the cabinet operators need the most basic of service, and coin menu functions for day to day operations. At this point in
time a power outage, or a stick button / stick would be very disruptive to normal usage. The lack of a universal test or service core seems counter-intuitive in my opinion. The menu 
itself is a point of contention for many folks. Some argue it is overly simplistic for what the system is capable of, others saying that it is no less appropriate then the menuing of
common multi-cart platforms.  

These are a few comments tha I ran across while looking around for others that had possibly found the settings necessary for a more rich arcade experience while using MiSTer. 

"MiSTer is not made specifically for arcade cabinets. It's primarily for home TV use" <br>

"While i can't help with output part (it's very specific to each arcade if it doesn't provide standard input like HDMI), i plan to make a thread where i can explain how to connect buttons easily to MiSTer without changing anything in MiSTer." <br>

"As a potential customer feedback, my use of MiSTer is... arcade: being able to play in a cab (JVS, mostly, but JAMMA option is still cool although I see it more as an external add-on)... having a DB15 connector is a must have IMO)" <br>

"I would suggest looking to the JVS standard for inspiration to avoid future head-aches."<br>

"I think the 2nd player controls are still pretty wonky on MiSTer, maybe them devs need mates to actually understand that gaming isnt only about player 1 :P"<br>

"Let me explain the reason why I would want to swap out the menu with something nicer. I'm looking at buying a MisterCADE." <br>

I personally don't usually use JAMMA, I'm more of a JVS guy. My cabs do however have the following looms. <br>
