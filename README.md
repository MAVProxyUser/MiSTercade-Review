The MiSTer arcade landscape needs to mature. 
Seems to have strong "consolidation" feel. 
Unnecessary focus on USB input, and HDMI output. 


Few folks seem to have actual "arcade" experience, or own cabs. 

"MiSTer is not made specifically for arcade cabinets. It's primarily for home TV use"

"As a potential customer feedback, my use of MiSTer is... arcade: being able to play in a cab (JVS, mostly, but JAMMA option is still cool although I see it more as an external add-on)... having a DB15 connector is a must have IMO)"

"While i can't help with output part (it's very specific to each arcade if it doesn't provide standard input like HDMI), i plan to make a thread where i can explain how to connect buttons easily to MiSTer without changing anything in MiSTer."

"I would suggest looking to the JVS standard for inspiration to avoid future head-aches."

"I think the 2nd player controls are still pretty wonky on MiSTer, maybe them devs need mates to actually understand that gaming isnt only about player 1 :P"

I personally don't usually use JAMMA, I'm more of a JVS guy. My cabs do however have the following looms.

"Let me explain the reason why I would want to swap out the menu with something nicer. I'm looking at buying a MisterCADE."
